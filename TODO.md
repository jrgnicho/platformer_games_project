- [x] Modify GameObject constructor to optionally take a BulletNode type in its constructor instead of creating a BulletRigidBody by default
- [x] Make the current Platform class into a SimplePlatform which contains two ledges, two walls, a surface and a box rigid body.  Make a new Platform class that is a more generic one that can hold multiple ledges, walls, rigid bodies and that can be composed using the bullet rigid and ghost bodies.
- [x] ~~Allow for the platform to have multiple rigid bodies located at an offset relative to the platforms coordinate system. It'd probably be best to setup the platforms main node as a empty BulletBodyNode and add all other bullet objects as children of the main node.~~ Use BulletRigidBody with multiple shapes instead.
- [x] Create a class to load platforms, motion planes, and entire levels from a blender file that has been properly constructed
- [x] ~~Use the [addShapesFromCollisionSolids](https://www.panda3d.org/reference/1.9.4/python/panda3d.bullet.BulletBodyNode#a27ec9d5f2712032c5f6177860ed749a7) method to create bullet collision shapes from loaded models.
This was never really used.
- [x] Make game object rigid body into a capsule instead of a box to allow displacing along slanted surfaces.
- [x] Rename the CharacterInfo class to CharacterProperties
- [x] Rename the CharacterStatus class to CharacterStateData
- [ ] Fix issue where a small portion of the character's collision capsule gets trapped inside platform mesh when changing from air dash to fall.  Use wall ghost node collision 
- [ ] Load sectors from blender files
- [ ] Fix climb ledge action around sloped platform.
- [ ] Add a climb point property to the ledge and get rid of having to categorize them as right or left sided.
